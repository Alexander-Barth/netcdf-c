Authorization Support in the netCDF-C Libraries {#oc_auth}
==================================================

\brief It is possible to support a number of authorization schemes
in the netCDF-C library.

With one exception, authorization in the netCDF-C library is
delegated to the oc2 code, which in turn delegates it to the
libcurl library. The exception is that the location of the rc
file can be specified by setting the environment variable *NCRCFILE*.
Note that the value of this environment variable should be the
absolute path of the rc file, not the path to its containing directory.

Following is the authorization documentation.
