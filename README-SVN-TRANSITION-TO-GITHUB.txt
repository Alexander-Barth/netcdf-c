Hello all,

In a move that has been a long time coming, we would like to announce
the transition from our in-house subversion repository to GitHub.
The netCDF C, Fortran, and C++ libraries will join other projects
such as THREDDS, IDV, GEMPACK, and LDM at the Unidata GitHub
repository, located at:

http://github.com/Unidata

The benefits of this transition, beyond bringing the netCDF projects
in line with other Unidata distributions, will be to improve
collaboration with other developers in our community.

For those unfamiliar with git and GitHub, no user account is required;
anonymous access is supported. You can fetch a copy of the repository
by using the 'git' command instead of the 'svn' command.  For those
unfamiliar with git,  GitHub hosts a series of tutorials and
screencasts which may be found here:

https://help.GitHub.com/articles/where-can-i-learn-more-about-git-and-GitHub.

There are also a number of free GUI front-ends for git, including
the GitHub GUI front-end and SourceTree for Windows and OSX.  Source
releases will still be accessible from the Unidata website, as will
binary releases (currently, only binaries for Windows are generated).

The target date for this transition is one week from today; Tuesday,
August 6th.  On this date the subversion repository will be frozen
during the transition; this process takes several hours in our
dry-runs.  Once the transition is complete, an announcement will
be made.  The subversion repository will stay around for 2 months
at least (actual EOL is TBD), but changes will not be made to it.

Thanks for your time, we look forward to our move to GitHub, and
are happy to answer any questions about this upcoming transition.


The netCDF team,

Russ, Dennis and Ward
